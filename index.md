## ⭐️ About Me

I am a **PhD student** at the Institute of Information Engineering (IIE), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS). Before this, I received my bachelor’s degree in Internet of Things Engineering from the University of Science and Technology Beijing in 2021. My research is supervised by Prof. **[Gaopeng Gou](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~gougaopeng)** and associate Prof. **[Jing Yu](https://mmlab-iie.github.io/#welcome)**. 
My primary research interests are **<span style="color:purple">multi-modal machine learning</span>** and **<span style="color:purple">cross-modal semantic alignment</span>**, and my current research focuses on **<span style="color:purple">description-based zero- / few-shot learning</span>** and **<span style="color:purple">cross-modal retrieval</span>**.
